				<td><p><center>The Sparrow isn't very reliable, bearing the same stats as the Bullfrog and Stoat in Kaycee's Mod, but with the Airborne Sigil. It can be considered a weaker but cheaper version of the Raven, so any strategy applicable to the Raven can also be applied here. A single Campfire buff to either Power or Health can instantly turn it into a budget Raven. Sigils that allow for multiple attacks, such as Bifurcated and Double Strike. Stinky increases its survivability, particularly early on. Though waterborne negates the Health of the card. Guardian and Burrower put the card in danger.</center></p></td>

				<td><p><center>All variants of the Bloodhound are mostly defensive cards. Whenever the opponent plays a card, they will change lanes to block the incoming attack. They cannot move if something is already opposing the card played. This can make them difficult to use, especially if they move to oppose a card that is capable of defeating them. They are also difficult to play, most of the time, due to their high costs.With the Bloodhound in Act I, increasing its Health is a recommendation so that it can fight back. Giving it Sigils such as Mighty Leap or Sharp Quills can enhance its defensive properties even further. The Waterborne sigil allows it to retaliate without being damaged, but as it negates the intended purpose of the Guardian Sigil, use this strategy carefully.</center></p></td>

				<td><p><center>The Touch of Death sigil allows the Long Elk to quickly destroy many opposing cards, while its Sprinter sigil, in combination with its two Health, allows it to survive counterattacks more easily than the Adder. When used in the Campfire, it is recommended to upgrade its Health or let the survivors eat it as it will kill them. The Vertebrae can provide extra defense from incoming threats or provide more sacrifice material.Note: The Vertabare do not inherit any infused Sigils on the Long Elk. However, Sigils acquired through a totem will appear on the Vertabrae. Consider this when using Long Elk, as it can prove massively beneficial.</center></p></td>
